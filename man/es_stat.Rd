\usage{
es_stat(m1, m2, sd1, sd2, n1, n2, p1, p2, r, nr, type = c("d", "g", "Zr",
  "lnOR", "lnRR", "lnCVR", "lnVR", "lnHR"))
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{The type specifies the specific effect statistics one wishes to calculate. Types include: "d", "g", "Zr","lnOR", "lnHR", "lnRR", "lnCVR", "lnVR".}
}
\description{
Function for calculating common effect size statistics.  Effect size statistics include both the effect size itself and it's sampling error. This function estimates both commonly used effect sizes (Hedges' d & g, Zr, lnOR, lnRR) along with less commonly used (lnHR) or newly developed effect sizes (i.e. for variance: lnCVR, lnVR, lnSD).

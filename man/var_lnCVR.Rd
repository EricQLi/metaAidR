\usage{
var_lnCVR(m1, m2, sd1, sd2, n1, n2, Equal.E.C.Corr = TRUE,
  repeated.control = FALSE, Control.IDs)
}
\arguments{
\item{m1}{Mean of treatment 1}

\item{m2}{Mean of treatment 2}

\item{sd1}{Standard deviation of treatment 1}

\item{sd2}{Standard deviation of treatment 2}

\item{n1}{Sample size of treatment 1}

\item{n2}{Sample size of treatment 2}

\item{Equal.E.C.Corr}{Logical indicating whether the the correlation between mean and variance is equal in both treatment groups.}

\item{repeated.control}{Logical indicating whether there are repeated control groups used in the data set.}

\item{Control.IDs}{A vector indicating which rows share a common control}

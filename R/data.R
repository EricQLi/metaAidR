#' @description Data set on bird egg sexual size dimorphism meta-analysis. Data was taken from Rutkowska et al. (2014). In this study more than one egg came from the same study which introduces non-independence in the data (i.e. correlated structure). As a sensitivity analysis Rutkowska et al. (2014) used an effective sample size proposed by Higgins and Green (2009), which requires an estimate of the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) in the calculation of effect sizes. In this case, an ICC estimate of 0.8 was used.
